<h1 class="text">Responsive Redesign</h1>
<a href="https://www.providenceschools.org/hope">Hope High School</a>
<p>
    I decided to redesign the website for Hope High School in Providence, RI. I did so because I thought the layout could be restructured to present the information more clearly.
</p>

<h1 style="margin-top:2em">Problems</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The Quick Links section was at the bottom of the page, resulting in low efficiency for users who simply want to access the information provided by the Quick Links section.</li>
    <li>Information on the website was redundant; for example, the location of the High School was present on both the home page and the Site Map link in the Quick Links section.</li>
    <li>The grouping of links and information on the website was not intuitive; links were split up into many sections on the website, and it was unclear why certain items were grouped together, resulting in both low learnability and low memorability.</li>
    <li>The conceptual model did not seem effective in accomplishing its goals; both parents and students have difficulty accessing the locations they most likely will use the most often (the Skyward login portal for students, and the newsletter for parents.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">WebAIM Wave Scan</h2>
<p>The WebAIM Wave scan showed few accessibility errors, which I generally agree with; most of the struggles in the website primarily stemmed from the placing of information.</p>
